# App template spec (fast path)

Use this spec for rapid, consistent app generation. Keep the layout generic and polished.

## Layout

- 3-column grid: left rail (actions + summary), center (primary workspace), right rail (activity + status).
- Top bar with app title + workspace chip + status indicator.
- Primary action button + secondary ghost buttons.
- Provide at least one "canvas" or "workspace" surface in the center.

## Visuals

- Dark, gradient background with soft neon glow accents (cyan + magenta).
- Panels are translucent with subtle borders and blur.
- Typography: Space Grotesk (already in template).
- Avoid heavy outlines; use soft, layered depth.

## Motion

- Light hover transitions on cards and buttons.
- Avoid complex animations unless requested.

## Data density

- Use summary cards (metrics) + timeline list for activity.
- Keep copy short and structured.

## Quality bar

- App should feel “real”: multiple sections, clear information hierarchy, and interactive controls.
- If user wants a specific app (CRM, analytics, tracker, etc.), adapt the center panel and cards to that domain.
